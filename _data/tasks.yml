    In our daily lives, we all perform acts of kindness for others. Youâ€™re free to choose anything you wish, big or small, but it should be something you would not have normally done. Do more than one.

    There are many types of meditation, but most have four elements in common: a quiet location; a specific, comfortable posture (sitting, lying down, walking); a focus of attention (sensations of the breath or body part, a specially chosen word or set of words, an object); and an open attitude (letting distractions come and go naturally without judging them).

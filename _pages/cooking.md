### Instructions:
With the hustle of life meals often get forgotten about and have become more centered around convenience rather than what one needs to eat and enjoys to eat. Take the time to cook yourself a more extravagant meal that you enjoy. Share your creation with friends and family, or just keep it to yourself! Some meal ideas are listed below, but feel free to cook any recipe of your choosing!

### Evidence:
Multiple peer-reviewed studies point towards cooking, baking, etc. as being associated with positive psychosocial outcomes. Food preparation is a cognitive, physical, and socioemotional process, benefitting both physical and mental wellbeing [Farmer, Touchton-Leonard, and Ross (2017) *Psychosocial Benefits of Cooking Interventions: A Systematic Review*]

# Take a Technology Break: 

&nbsp;

*Time: 2-24hrs*

&nbsp;

***Being on devices all day long can be draining and distracting. People feel less connection and empathy towards others when cell phones are part of a conversation, and the presence of cell phones can reduce people’s intellectual sharpness. Step back from technology for an extended period of time and spend time doing something you love or with people you love, without technology.***

&nbsp;

### Instructions:
Whether for 2 hours or the full 24 hours -- as long as your schedule allows -- here are some suggestions for what you can do during this time:

- Think critically about your media consumption
- Engage in face-to-face conversations
- Regulate your sleep schedule

If you feel this may be a challenge with the constant notifications and buzzing your phone will produce, we recommend installing <a href="https://freedom.to" target="_blank">Freedom app</a> which will mute all possible notifications for the time period you alot.

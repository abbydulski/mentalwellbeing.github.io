***Today we would like you to try to change your behavior. Specifically, try to act as talkative, assertive, and spontaneous as you can during the whole day or find a situation during a day to act this way; for example, a work meeting, dinner, or a social event. Previous research has shown that performing these behaviors enhanced positive emotions.***

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Instructions:
Please make a list of 5 specific ideas for how and when you will incorporate these types of behaviors into
your daily life. For example, “When my friends or relatives are discussing something
important to me, I will express my opinion.”

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Evidence: 
Extraverted behavior has shown to increase positive affect, feelings of connectedness and flow (feelings of being in the zone, fully immersed, energized) [Jacques-Hamilton (2018) Journal of Experimental Psychology; Margolis & Lyubomirsky (2020) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General].

# Meditation: 

&nbsp;

*Time: 5-25m*

&nbsp;

***There are many types of meditation, but most have four elements in common: 
- a quiet location; a specific, comfortable posture (sitting, lying down, walking)
- a focus of attention (sensations of the breath or body part, a specially chosen word or set of words, an object)
- and an open attitude (letting distractions come and go naturally without judging them)***

#### Evidence: 
Evidence from NCCIH: Many studies have investigated meditation for different conditions, and there’s evidence that it may increase wellbeing, ease symptoms of anxiety and depression, help people with insomnia, reduce blood pressure as well as symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and flare-ups in people who have had ulcerative colitis.

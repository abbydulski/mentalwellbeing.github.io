# Meditation: 

&nbsp;

*Time: 5-25m*

&nbsp;

***There are many types of meditation, but most have four elements in common: a quiet location; a specific, comfortable posture (sitting, lying down, walking); a focus of attention (sensations of the breath or body part, a specially chosen word or set of words, an object); and an open attitude (letting distractions come and go naturally without judging them).***

#### Evidence:

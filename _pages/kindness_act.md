*Time: 20-60m+*

***In our daily lives, we all perform acts of kindness for others. You’re free to choose anything you wish, big or small, but it should be something you would not have normally done. Do more than one.***

### Around the house:
- cooking dinner or a treat for people in your house or a neighbor
- doing an extra chore (mop the kitchen floor or vacuum common space, clean bathroom)

### Related to work/school:
- offering to help a friend with project, research or homework

### Social acts:
- posting something kind on someone’s social media or sending a kind email
- having a nonwork conversation with a coworker or classmate
- calling a family member or a friend and listen to their issues or stories, especially think of those who may be alone.
- buying flowers for your partner
- doing an activity with your family or housemates that they love to do

### Contributing money:
- donating to a charity <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities" target="_blank">(here are some “evidence-backed, thoroughly vetted, underfunded organizations)</a>
- shipping a family member something from their Amazon wish list
- contributing to a coworker’s GoFundMe project

### Quick acts of kindness (you can do several):
- giving someone a compliment
- helping strangers with small tasks - opening doors, carrying shoppings, etc.
- being friendly to a stranger (or a kid, or a pet), e.g. greet them or smile to them
- spending extra time with your pet, eg. walking your dog an extra time

***The acts do not need to be for the same person, the person may or may not be aware of the act, and the act may or may not be similar to the acts listed above. Please do not perform any acts that may place yourself or others in danger and please follow your local social distancing legislation.***

#### Evidence: 
Studies have shown that performing random acts of kindness for others boosts peer acceptance and wellbeing [<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111" target="_blank">Lyubomirsky et al. (2005). Review of General Psychology</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051380" target="_blank">Layous et al. (2012). PLoS ONE</a>] and can reduce inflammatory-related patterns of gene expression [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28395185/" target="_blank">Nelson-Coffey, Fritz, Lyubomirsky, & Cole, 2017. Kindness in the blood: A randomized controlled trial of the gene regulatory impact of prosocial behavior</a>]. Indeed, some researchers have argued that the cross-cultural effects of prosocial spending (e.g., donating money to charity) on well-being constitutes a psychological universal [<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-04859-001" target="_blank">Aknin et al., 2013. Prosocial spending and well-being: Cross-cultural evidence for a psychological universal</a>].
